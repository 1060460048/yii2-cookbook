Single table inheritance
========================

There is no native inheritance support in most relational databases so it should be implemented manually if needed.
One of approaches to the problem is called [single table inheritance](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/singleTableInheritance.html)
described well by Martin Fowler.

According to the pattern in the entity table we have additional column called `type` that determines which class will
be instantiated from the row of data.

Let's implement simple car types inheritance with the following class structure:

```
Car
|- SportCar
|- HeavyCar
```

Get ready
---------

We'll use basic application. After creating and setting up database execute the follwing SQL to create the table
and insert some data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `car` (
    `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    `type` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);

INSERT INTO car (id, NAME, TYPE) VALUES (1, 'Kamaz', 'heavy'), (2, 'Ferrari', 'sport'), (3, 'BMW', 'city');
```

Now use Gii to generate `Car` model.


How to do it...
---------------

Create models extending from `Car`. First `SportCar`:

```php
namespace app\models;

class SportCar extends Car
{
    const TYPE = 'sport';

    public static function find()
    {
        return parent::find()->where(['type' => self::TYPE]);
    }

    public function beforeSave($insert)
    {
        $this->type = TYPE;
        return parent::beforeSave($insert);
    }
}
```

Then `HeavyCar`:

```php
namespace app\models;

class HeavyCar extends Car
{
    const TYPE = 'heavy';

    public static function find()
    {
        return parent::find()->where(['type' => self::TYPE]);
    }

    public function beforeSave($insert)
    {
        $this->type = TYPE;
        return parent::beforeSave($insert);
    }
}
```

Now we need to override `instantiate` method in `Car` model:

```php
public static function instantiate($row)
{
    switch ($row['type']) {
        case SportCar::TYPE:
            return new SportCar();
        case HeavyCar::TYPE:
            return new HeavyCar();
        default:
           return new self;
    }
}
```

That's it. Let's try it. Create the follwing `actionTest` in `SiteController` and run it:

```php
// finding all cars we have
$cars = Car::find()->all();
foreach ($cars as $car) {
    echo "$car->id $car->name " . get_class($car) . "<br />";
}

// finding any sport car
$sportCar = SportCar::find()->one();
echo "$sportCar->id $sportCar->name " . get_class($sportCar) . "<br />";
```

The output should be:

```
1 Kamaz app\models\HeavyCar
2 Ferrari app\models\SportCar
3 BMW app\models\Car
2 Ferrari app\models\SportCar
```

That means models are now instantiated according to `type` field and the search is performed as expected.

How it works...
---------------

`SportCar` and `HeavyCar` models are quite similar. They both extend from `Car`and have two methods overridden. In
`find` method we're modifying initial condition so `SportCar` will only search for sport cars and `HeavyCar` will only search for
heavy cars. In `beforeSave` we're making sure that proper type is written to database when class is saved. `TYPE` constants
are introduced just for convenience. Note that `find` provides initial condition so one should use `andWhere` when working with such models instead of `where` which will override it.

The `Car` model is pretty much what was generated by Gii except additional `instantiate` method. This method is called
after data is retrieved from database and is about to be used to initialize class properties. Return value is uninitialized
class instance and the only argument passed to the method is the row of data got from database. Exactly what we need.
The implementation is a simple switch statement where we're checking if type field matches type of the classes we suport.
If so, instance of the class is returned. If nothing matches it falls back to returning `Car` model instance.
